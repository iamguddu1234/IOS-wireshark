    Wireshark provides advanced statistics and graphing features that allow for in-depth analysis and visualization of network traffic patterns. Here are some advanced Wireshark statistics and graphing capabilities:
    """
    let nn3 = """
    1. Conversations Statistics:
    """
    let nn4 = """
    - Analyze conversations by protocol, source/destination IP, source/destination port, packet count, bytes transferred, etc.
    """
    let nn5 = """
    - Graph conversations over time to visualize traffic patterns and identify anomalies.
    """
    let nn6 = """
    2. Endpoint Statistics:
    """
    let nn7 = """
    - Analyze endpoint statistics such as packet count, bytes transferred, average packet size, etc.
    """
    let nn8 = """
    - Graph endpoint statistics to compare traffic distribution among different endpoints.
    """
    let nn9 = """
    3. Protocol Hierarchy Statistics:
    """
    let nn10 = """
    - View statistics of the network traffic based on the protocol hierarchy.
    """
    let nn11 = """
    - Identify which protocols contribute the most to the overall network traffic.
    """
    let nn12 = """
    4. I/O Graph:
    """
    let nn13 = """
    - Generate customizable graphs to visualize network statistics over time.
    """
    let nn14 = """
    - Plot parameters such as packet rate, bytes transferred, round-trip time, etc.
    """
    let nn15 = """
    5. Flow Graph:
    """
    let nn16 = """
    - Visualize the flow of packets between endpoints to understand the sequence and timing of communication.
    """
    let nn17 = """
    - Identify patterns such as bursty traffic, periodic flows, etc.
    """
    let nn18 = """
    6. Expert Info:
    """
    let nn19 = """
    - Analyze the expert info messages generated by Wireshark to identify potential issues in the captured traffic.
    """
    let nn20 = """
    - Filter and sort expert info messages based on severity and types of problems detected.
    """
    let nn21 = """
    7. Time-Interval Analysis:
    """
    let nn22 = """
    - Analyze network statistics and traffic patterns over specific time intervals.
    """
    let nn23 = """
    - Compare traffic characteristics between different time periods for performance analysis.
    """
    let nn24 = """
    8. Statistical Summary:
    """
    let nn25 = """
    - Obtain statistical summaries of various network parameters such as packet size distribution, inter-arrival times, etc.
    """
    let nn26 = """
    - Identify outliers, anomalies, and deviations from normal traffic behavior.
    """
    let nn27 = """
    9. Top Talkers:
    """
    let nn28 = """
    - Identify the top talkers in terms of the amount of traffic generated or received.
    """
    let nn29 = """
    - View statistics for specific endpoints or protocols to pinpoint network bottlenecks.
    """
    let nn30 = """
    10. Round-Trip Time (RTT) Graph:
    """
    let nn31 = """
    - Plot round-trip times for specific conversations or protocols.
    """
    let nn32 = """
    - Analyze latency issues and identify delays in network communication.
    """
    let nn33 = """
    These advanced statistics and graphing features in Wireshark provide insights into network traffic behavior, performance, and anomalies. They help in identifying patterns, understanding network dynamics, and troubleshooting network issues. Utilizing these capabilities can greatly enhance the analysis and interpretation of network captures.
